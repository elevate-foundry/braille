# BrailleBuddy - Learn Braille Through Play

BrailleBuddy is an interactive web application designed to help sighted children learn and practice braille in a fun and engaging way. This project aims to promote braille literacy among sighted children, fostering inclusivity and accessibility awareness from an early age.

## Features

- **Learn Mode**: Interactive display of the braille alphabet with descriptions and context for each letter
- **Practice Mode**: Test your knowledge by identifying braille characters
- **Games**: Fun activities to reinforce braille learning (Memory Match, Word Builder, and Speedster)
- **Haptic Feedback**: Feel braille patterns through vibration on mobile devices with multiple encoding options (Standard, Rhythmic, Frequency-based, and Biological Contractions)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch gestures, responsive design, and fullscreen mode for learning on-the-go
- **About Section**: Educational information about braille and its importance

## Why Learn Braille?

Learning braille offers several benefits for sighted children:

- Promotes empathy and understanding for visually impaired people
- Enhances cognitive development and pattern recognition skills
- Improves tactile sensitivity and fine motor skills
- Builds accessibility awareness from an early age
- Creates a more inclusive society

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start exploring and learning braille!

## Technical Details

BrailleBuddy is built using:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Web Vibration API for haptic feedback
- Web Bluetooth API for future hardware integration

### Haptic Feedback Modes

The application offers four distinct haptic feedback modes to enhance the learning experience:

1. **Standard**: Simple dot-by-dot vibration pattern that directly corresponds to the braille cell
2. **Rhythmic**: Creates patterns with varying durations that help distinguish between different characters
3. **Frequency-based**: Varies the intensity of vibrations based on the number and position of dots in the braille cell
4. **Biological Contractions**: Mimics physiological contractions with wave-like patterns that build up, peak, and taper off, creating an intuitive tactile experience for learning braille contractions

No external libraries or frameworks are required, making it lightweight and easy to run on any modern web browser. The application is designed to be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for numbers and punctuation in braille
- Expand game offerings with additional educational activities
- Enhance haptic feedback with customizable patterns for different learning styles
- Integrate with physical braille learning devices via Bluetooth
- Implement adaptive learning algorithms to personalize the learning experience
- Add multi-language support for international braille standards
