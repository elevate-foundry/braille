  "text": "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. The decision overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896, which had allowed state-sponsored segregation in public education. The Court's unanimous decision stated that 'separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,' and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe case originated in 1951 when the public school district in Topeka, Kansas, refused to enroll local black resident Oliver Brown's daughter at the school closest to their home, instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black elementary school farther away. The Browns and twelve other local black families in similar situations then filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Topeka Board of Education, alleging that its segregation policy was unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas rendered a verdict against the Browns, relying on the precedent of the Supreme Court's decision in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had upheld a state law requiring 'separate but equal' segregated facilities for blacks and whites in railway cars. The Browns, then represented by NAACP chief counsel Thurgood Marshall, appealed to the Supreme Court, which consolidated their case with other similar segregation cases into Brown v. Board of Education."
