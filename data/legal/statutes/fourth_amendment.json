  "text": "Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the Bill of Rights. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and requires any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause. It is fundamental to U.S. criminal procedure in setting the terms under which government authorities may conduct searches and seizures of persons, their property, and their homes.\n\nThe Supreme Court has interpreted the Fourth Amendment as providing protection against searches and seizures conducted by government officials that are deemed unreasonable under the law. The Fourth Amendment is not a guarantee against all searches and seizures, but only those that are deemed unreasonable under the law. Whether a particular search or seizure is considered reasonable is determined by balancing the intrusion on an individual's Fourth Amendment rights against the government's legitimate interests, such as public safety."
