  "text": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nThe First Amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights. The First Amendment prohibits Congress from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the freedom of assembly, or the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\n\nThe First Amendment has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as applying to the entire federal government even though it is only expressly applicable to Congress. Furthermore, the Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as protecting the rights in the First Amendment from interference by state governments. The freedom of speech, the press, and assembly have been viewed as inherently political in nature, being essential to the democratic process."
