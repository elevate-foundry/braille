# Implement SAL Core Engine for AI-Driven Adaptivity

## Description
This pull request implements the core engine for SAL (Smart Adaptive Learning), fulfilling our priority for AI-driven adaptivity in BrailleBuddy. SAL is designed to dynamically adjust difficulty based on user performance, providing a personalized learning experience for each user.

## Changes Made
1. Implemented the adaptive learning algorithm in `sal-assistant.js`:
   - Created performance-based difficulty scaling
   - Built user proficiency tracking across different braille elements
   - Implemented spaced repetition for optimal learning retention

2. Developed the performance tracking system:
   - Added metrics for measuring user proficiency in letters, numbers, and contractions
   - Created storage for user performance history
   - Implemented analytics to identify strengths and areas for improvement

3. Built SAL's personality and interaction model:
   - Designed encouraging and supportive feedback patterns
   - Created adaptive hints based on user struggle points
   - Implemented contextual responses to user actions

4. Connected SAL to universal braille support:
   - Integrated with the UniversalBrailleHandler for multilingual capability
   - Enabled SAL to adapt challenges across different braille codes
   - Created language-specific learning paths

## Testing Performed
- Unit tests for the adaptive algorithm components
- Integration tests with universal braille support
- Performance tests to ensure smooth user experience
- Simulated learning sessions with various user profiles

## Related Issues
- Builds on the universal braille support implementation
- Addresses user priority for AI-driven adaptivity
- Prepares foundation for personalized progress tracking

## Dependencies
- Requires the universal braille support PR to be merged first
- Uses the braille language patterns for multilingual support

## Notes for Reviewers
- The adaptive algorithm parameters may need tuning based on user testing
- SAL's personality is designed to be encouraging but not intrusive
- The performance tracking system is extensible for future analytics
- This PR focuses on the core engine; the UI enhancements will come in a separate PR
