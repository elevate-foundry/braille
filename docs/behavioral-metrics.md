## Privacy Considerations

The BBID behavioral fingerprinting system is designed with privacy in mind:

1. **No Personal Data**: We do not collect any personally identifiable information.
2. **No Keystroke Content**: While we track typing patterns, we do not record the actual keys pressed.
3. **Data Minimization**: We limit the amount of data stored and transmitted.
4. **Transparency**: This documentation provides full transparency about what is collected.
5. **User Consent**: Implementation should always include clear user consent mechanisms.

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Selective Collection**: Only collect metrics relevant to your use case.
2. **Throttling**: Use appropriate sample rates to minimize performance impact.
3. **Batch Processing**: Process and submit data in batches to reduce network overhead.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for all data collection.
5. **Testing**: Test across different devices and browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
