# Fix Number Sign Display for Universal Braille Support

## Description
This pull request fixes the issue with the number sign not displaying correctly when numbers are selected in the BrailleBuddy application. The number sign is a critical component of universal braille support as it's used to indicate that the following character is a number. This implementation supports both single-digit and multi-digit numbers, ensuring comprehensive universal braille support.

## Changes Made
1. Enhanced the `displayBrailleLetter` function in `script.js` to properly handle the number sign display:
   - Added additional debugging logs to track the number sign container and pattern
   - Improved error handling for the number sign dots
   - Ensured proper visibility of the number sign container
   - Added support for multi-digit numbers with appropriate descriptions
   - Updated the regex pattern to detect numbers of any length

2. Updated the CSS styling for the number sign container in `styles.css`:
   - Added explicit display properties
   - Improved visibility and opacity settings
   - Enhanced the styling of the number sign cell for better visual representation

3. Added a test page (`test-number-sign.html`) to verify the fix:
   - Created a simplified test environment to isolate the number sign display functionality
   - Added detailed logging for debugging purposes
   - Implemented test buttons for different numbers and letters
   - Added specific tests for multi-digit numbers (12, 456)
   - Included special handling for multi-digit number patterns

## Testing Performed
- Verified that the number sign container is properly displayed when a number is selected
- Confirmed that the number sign dots (3, 4, 5, and 6) are correctly activated
- Tested with multiple numbers to ensure consistent behavior
- Created a dedicated test page to isolate and verify the fix
- Verified that multi-digit numbers (e.g., 12, 456) display the number sign correctly
- Confirmed that the appropriate descriptions are shown for both single-digit and multi-digit numbers

## Related Issues

## Screenshots
N/A - Visual changes are best observed in the running application

## Notes for Reviewers
- The fix focuses specifically on the number sign display issue
- The test page can be used to verify the fix independently of the main application
- This change is part of our effort to implement universal braille support beyond just English/UEB
- The implementation follows universal braille standards where numbers are preceded by a number sign regardless of their length
- This fix is an important step toward our goal of supporting multilingual and universal braille beyond just UEB
