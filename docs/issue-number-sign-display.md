# Issue: Number Sign Not Displaying in Braille Representation

## Description
When users select a number in the BrailleBuddy application, the number sign (dots 3, 4, 5, and 6) is not being displayed properly. In braille, numbers are represented using the same patterns as the first ten letters (a-j) but are preceded by a special "number sign" which uses dots 3, 4, 5, and 6. This is a critical issue for universal braille support as it affects the correct representation of numbers across all braille codes.

## Expected Behavior
- When a user selects a number (0-9), the number sign container should be visible
- The number sign dots (3, 4, 5, and 6) should be properly activated
- The number pattern itself should be displayed correctly

## Current Behavior
- The number sign container appears to be present in the HTML
- The CSS for the number sign container is properly defined
- The number sign pattern is correctly defined in the `getBrailleAlphabet` function
- However, the number sign is not being displayed when a number is selected

## Root Cause
After investigation, the issue appears to be in the `displayBrailleLetter` function. While the function includes code to show the number sign container and activate the dots, there may be issues with:

1. The scope of the `brailleGrid` variable
2. The activation of the number sign dots
3. The display of the number sign container

## Proposed Solution
1. Ensure the `brailleGrid` variable is properly scoped
2. Fix the number sign dot activation in the `displayBrailleLetter` function
3. Verify that the number sign container is properly displayed when a number is selected
4. Add additional debugging to ensure the number sign is working correctly

## Priority
High - This is essential for universal braille support, which is a high priority enhancement for BrailleBuddy.
