# BBID Privacy Controls Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan outlines the procedures for evaluating the BBID privacy controls implementation across different devices and browsers, ensuring that behavioral fingerprinting works effectively while respecting user privacy preferences.

## Test Environments

### Devices
- Desktop/Laptop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Smartphones (iOS, Android)
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)

### Browsers
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (Safari iOS, Chrome Android)

## Test Cases

### 1. Consent Management

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| CON-01 | Load the privacy-demo.html page for the first time | Consent dialog should appear, tracking should not start | High |
| CON-02 | Accept consent | Consent should be stored, dialog should close, tracking should be available | High |
| CON-03 | Reject consent | Limited functionality should be available, minimal data collection | High |
| CON-04 | Reload page after accepting consent | Consent dialog should not reappear, consent status should persist | High |
| CON-05 | Test consent expiration (set to 90 days) | After expiration, consent should be requested again | Medium |

### 2. Privacy Settings

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| PRV-01 | Toggle keyboard tracking off | Keyboard metrics should not be collected | High |
| PRV-02 | Toggle mouse tracking off | Mouse metrics should not be collected | High |
| PRV-03 | Toggle touch tracking off | Touch metrics should not be collected | High |
| PRV-04 | Toggle motion tracking off | Motion metrics should not be collected | High |
| PRV-05 | Toggle session tracking off | Session metrics should be limited | High |
| PRV-06 | Toggle UI tracking off | UI interaction metrics should not be collected | High |
| PRV-07 | Save settings | Settings should persist across page reloads | High |
| PRV-08 | Delete data | All stored behavioral data should be removed | High |

### 3. Data Minimization & Anonymization

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| MIN-01 | Test minimal anonymization level | Basic anonymization should be applied | Medium |
| MIN-02 | Test standard anonymization level | Timing values should be rounded, specific key info removed | High |
| MIN-03 | Test maximum anonymization level | All metrics should be converted to relative scores | Medium |
| MIN-04 | Compare raw vs. filtered data | Filtered data should have less precise information | High |
| MIN-05 | Verify no personal data is collected | No PII should be present in any data | Critical |

### 4. Behavioral Fingerprinting Effectiveness

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| EFF-01 | Generate fingerprint with full permissions | High confidence score (>70%) | High |
| EFF-02 | Generate fingerprint with limited permissions | Lower but still usable confidence score (>40%) | High |
| EFF-03 | Test same user on same device/browser | Should produce similar fingerprints | High |
| EFF-04 | Test different users on same device/browser | Should produce different fingerprints | High |
| EFF-05 | Test same user on different devices/browsers | Should identify differences but maintain some consistency | Medium |

### 5. Cross-Browser & Cross-Device Testing

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| XBR-01 | Test on Chrome desktop | All features should work as expected | High |
| XBR-02 | Test on Firefox desktop | All features should work as expected | High |
| XBR-03 | Test on Safari desktop | All features should work as expected | High |
| XBR-04 | Test on Edge desktop | All features should work as expected | High |
| XBR-05 | Test on Chrome mobile | Touch and motion features should work | High |
| XBR-06 | Test on Safari iOS | Touch and motion features should work | High |
| XBR-07 | Test on tablet browsers | Touch features should work | Medium |

### 6. Performance & Usability

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| PER-01 | Measure page load time with privacy controls | Should not add significant overhead (<200ms) | Medium |
| PER-02 | Measure CPU usage during tracking | Should not cause noticeable performance issues | Medium |
| PER-03 | Test UI responsiveness during tracking | UI should remain responsive | High |
| PER-04 | Test privacy controls UI usability | Controls should be intuitive and accessible | High |

## Test Procedure

### Setup
1. Deploy the privacy-demo.html page to a test server
2. Prepare test devices with required browsers
3. Clear browser data between tests

### Execution
For each test case:
1. Follow the test description steps
2. Record the actual result
3. Compare with expected result
4. Document any deviations or issues

### Data Collection
For each test, collect:
- Screenshots of the UI
- Raw and filtered behavioral data
- Confidence scores
- Performance metrics

## Reporting

Create a test report with:
1. Summary of test results
2. Pass/fail status for each test case
3. Issues discovered with severity ratings
4. Recommendations for improvements
5. Cross-browser/cross-device compatibility matrix

## Privacy Evaluation Metrics

Evaluate the privacy implementation using these metrics:
1. Data minimization effectiveness: Compare raw vs. filtered data size
2. Anonymization effectiveness: Assess uniqueness of filtered data
3. User control effectiveness: Verify settings actually limit data collection
4. Transparency: Evaluate clarity of privacy explanations
5. Compliance: Verify adherence to privacy best practices

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating the BBID privacy controls implementation. By following these procedures, we can ensure that the behavioral fingerprinting system respects user privacy while maintaining effective identification capabilities across different devices and browsers.
