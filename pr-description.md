# Fix Behavioral Fingerprinting and Add Design System

## Overview
This PR fixes the behavioral fingerprinting functionality that was stuck in the "Collecting data" state and adds a comprehensive design system for the BBID interface to improve the user experience. The latest update addresses an issue with the fingerprint hash not being available in the behavioral fingerprinting initialization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Behavioral Fingerprinting
- Fixed the client-side implementation in `bbid-chatgpt-test.html` that was causing the behavioral fingerprinting to be stuck in the "Collecting data" state
- Corrected the method call from `startTracking()` to `start()` to match the actual method name in the `BBIDBehavioral` class
- Added a global variable `globalFingerprintHash` to store the device fingerprint hash and make it accessible across functions
- Fixed the undefined `fpHash` variable by using the global fingerprint variable instead
- Implemented the `onFingerprintGenerated` callback to process and display the behavioral data
- Added code to extract and display useful metrics from the behavioral data

### 2. Added Design System
- Created a comprehensive design system in `css/bbid-design-system.css` to ensure a modern and cohesive look across the UI
- Implemented a consistent color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Added typography styles with responsive font sizes and line heights
- Created component styles for buttons, cards, forms, and other UI elements
- Added utility classes for spacing, layout, and responsive design

## Testing
- Verified that behavioral fingerprinting now correctly collects and displays data instead of being stuck in the "Collecting data" state
- Confirmed that the fingerprint hash is properly stored in a global variable and used in the behavioral fingerprinting initialization
- Confirmed that the behavioral metrics are properly displayed in the UI
- Tested the design system components across different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior

## Screenshots
N/A - UI changes are included in the code and can be viewed after deployment

## Deployment Notes
After merging, Vercel will automatically deploy the changes. The fixed behavioral fingerprinting functionality can be tested at:
